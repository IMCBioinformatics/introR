The International Microbiome Centreâ€™s bioinformatics platform is announcing a second offering of our Introduction to R for Biologists course.

Introduction to R for Biologists - March 9-10, 2020

The purpose of this course is to teach scientists (students, postdocs, PIs, and staff) in biological and medical sciences to use R for typical data analysis tasks they might encounter routinely. No prior knowledge of R is expected and workshop attendees can expect to come away with a skill set that is immediately translatable to their respective data tasks.
