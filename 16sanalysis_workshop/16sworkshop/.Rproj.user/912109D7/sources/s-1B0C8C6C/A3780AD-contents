# Day One
We are very excited to teach this course for the first time and share what we know with you all

So lets start by talking about the very basics:


## What are we trying to achieve
  
Our goal is very similar to gathering data on a city neighbourhood to find out who lives there, how the demographic changes over time  or in case of a drastic event. We can gather more information by asking about neighbours, quality of life etc. Similarly when we are looking at microbial communities our first question is who is there, how abundant and how their presence changes over time or when conditions change. We can also ask questions like how the microbiomes are interacting with each other (metabolites).

## Basics & Background

Here is the link to the lecture we will  start with today: [lecture](microbiomeworkshop.pdf)

Key points are:

- Think of a hypothesis before doing an experiment
- Spend time on experiment design.
  - Sample size, 16s region to amplify etc
  - Talk to a bioinformatician
  - Think about the depth of sequencing if you want to capture the less abundant taxa
  - Add negative control to account for contamination
  
- Thoughtful data analysis is critical for successful identification of microbes

## DADA2 pipeline (v1.2)
 
From now on, we will be working on the DADA2 package version 1.12. DADA2 has great documentation and an excellent tutorial online that we will use to understand the pipeline. Please go to the following link http://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html

### Data for the tutorial
The data to use for the tutorial can be downloaded from [here](MiSeqSOPData.zip)  

### Getting ready ( load packages and get file list)

functions that we will be using here are :

- list.files()
- sort()
- strsplit()
- basename()
- sapply()

## Inspect read quality profiles


<!-- ```{r,readdata} -->
<!-- library(dada2); -->
<!-- library(limma) -->
<!-- path <- "MiSeq_SOP/" -->
<!-- list.files(path) -->
<!-- ```   -->

<!-- ```{r, findsamplenames} -->
<!-- # Forward and reverse fastq filenames have format: SAMPLENAME_R1_001.fastq and SAMPLENAME_R2_001.fastq -->
<!-- fnFs <- list.files(path, pattern="_R1_001.fastq", full.names = TRUE) -->
<!-- fnRs <- sort(list.files(path, pattern="_R2_001.fastq", full.names = TRUE)) -->
<!-- # Extract sample names, assuming filenames have format: SAMPLENAME_XXX.fastq -->
<!-- sample.names <- sort(strsplit2(basename(fnFs), "_")[,1]) -->
<!-- sample.names -->

<!-- ``` -->
